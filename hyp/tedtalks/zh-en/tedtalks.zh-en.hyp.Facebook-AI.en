I am committed to helping computers communicate with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given this scenario, a modern computer vision algorithm could tell you that there is a woman, and there is a dog.
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.
It can even tell you that the dog is very cute.
I deal with this by thinking about how humans understand and live with the world.
Those thoughts, memories and stories in such a scene, may arouse the attention of human beings.
The interconnectedness of all connected situations.
Perhaps you have seen such a dog before, or you have spent time running on such a beach, and further evoke memories and thoughts of past holidays, when you used to go to the beach and spend time running around with other dogs.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what it's like to experience, and therefore understand what we believe and feel in common, then we have the ability to start evolving computer technology in a way that is complementary to our experience.
So, digging deeper into this, I started working a few years ago on helping computers generate human-like stories from sequences of images.
So, one day, while I was working on my computer, I asked it what it thought about the trip to Australia.
It looked at the picture and saw a koala.
It doesn't know what a koala is, but the computer says it thinks koalas look like interesting creatures.
Then I share with the computer a series of images of a house burning down.
The computer looked at the picture and it said, "This is an amazing landscape! This is spectacular!"
It sends chills down my spine.
The computer sees a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thinks it's a positive thing.
I realized that the computer recognizes the contrast between red and yellow, and thinks that this is something to be evaluated positively.
Part of the reason is because most of what I type into the computer is positive imagery.
That's because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, the task is the task, and the data set is the data set, creating huge gaps, flaws and blind spots in the computer's understanding.
In doing so, I am coding for all kinds of biases.
Biases reflect limited perspectives, stemming from a data set that reflects the same things that humans do, such as preconceptions and stereotypes.
I think back to the development of the technology that got me to where I was that day - the first color image was calibrated for the skin color of a white woman, which meant that color photography was biased against blackface.
And that same bias, that blind spot, carried over into the '90s.
The same blind spot exists even today in the application of facial recognition technology, how to identify the faces of different people.
In today's research, I think of state-of-the-art technologies that tend to limit our thinking to one data set and one problem.
And in doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be further amplified when using AI.
I realized then that we have to think deeply about how the technologies we invent today will be perceived five to ten years from now.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so evolution is slow.
Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is advancing at an incredible rate.
That means it's really important that we think about this carefully now - to reflect on our own blind spots and biases, and to consider how those biases affect the technologies we create now, and to discuss what today's technologies mean for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed in with their thoughts on the future of AI development.
Stephen Hawking has warned: "Artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."
Elon Musk warns that this is an existential risk, and one of the biggest risks we face as a civilized society.
Bill Gates noted: "I don't understand why people aren't more worried about AI."
But these views are only part of the story.
The mathematics, the models, the fundamental building blocks of AI that we can all access and use.
We have open source tools for the general public to learn about the machine and contribute at the same time.
Beyond that, we can also share our experiences.
We can share about technology and how it relates to us, and how it excites us.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, which may be more beneficial in terms of technology, or over time, there may be more problems.
If we all focus on opening up the discussion about AI going forward, it will help create a regular conversation and awareness about what AI is, what it can become, and all the things we need to do to achieve the outcomes that are best for us.
We already see and understand this in the technology we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Maybe sometimes.
Are they beneficial?
Yes, they are.
They are not identical.
There you have seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to begin with what we build and create now.
We started a domino effect, which opened up the evolutionary pathway of artificial intelligence.
In our time, shaping the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
Let us immerse ourselves in the technology of augmented reality to revive the world of the past,
When people have trouble communicating, technology helps them share their experiences with each other.
Technology built on online visual media could be used in self-driving cars.
Technology that produces language based on the understanding of images can evolve into technology that assists the visually impaired, helping them to better own the visual world.
We also see how technology can cause some problems.
We have the technology today to analyze the physical characteristics of our birth - like the color of our skin or the expression on our face - to determine if we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology to process data, to process data about gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot in the evolution of AI.
Because where we are now is a moment in evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the development of things later, and extend to the future world.
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, we need to define strategies and goals and start down that path now.
What I want to see is the direction of development of culture and environment suitable for human beings.
Technology can help us cure patients with neurological diseases or other disabilities, making their lives just as challenging as everyone else's.
Technology operates without regard to your characteristics or the color of your skin.
What I focus on today is the technology of tomorrow and ten years from now,
AI can emerge in many different ways.
But in this case, it's not a driverless car without any destination.
This is a car we can drive and control at the same time.
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.
We choose whether we need to turn.
We choose what the AI of the future will be.
There will be a broad playing field, allowing AI to be all things.
It will become many different things.
It is now up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure that the outcome of AI is better for all of humanity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want you to take a moment to consider the very simple fact that, so far, most of what we know about the universe comes from light.
We stand on the earth and look up at the night sky. We can see the stars with our naked eyes.
The strong sunlight is so dazzling,
We can see the light reflected back from the moon,
Ever since Galileo aimed his rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies of the universe, the universe as we know it has been presented to us through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect dazzling silent images of the universe - a series of images that go all the way back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a silent opera, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and the universe itself is constantly playing, because space can vibrate like a drum.
So when something big happens, it can send out a series of sounds into the universe.
Now, we hope to give voice to this magnificent visual work about the universe.
Although we have never heard a voice from outer space, we should be able to turn up the volume in the next few years and hear what's really going on out there.
For the ambitious goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we're focusing on black holes and the promise they hold, because black holes can hit space-time like a drumstick hitting a drumhead with a very special sound, and I'm very excited to play you some of the sounds we predict.
Someday in the future we may be able to see a shadow A black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although black holes can't be seen, they can be heard, because they pound space-time like a drum.
The idea that the universe could make a sound like a drum came from Albert Einstein, and indeed many of our ideas come from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look just like this picture, except for those auxiliary lines painted on it.
But if we are in free fall in the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our trajectory will draw these lines, because we will find that we move along straight lines, along straight lines that do not bend through the universe.
Einstein also realized - and this is the really crucial part (matter also means "matter") - that if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will bend. Objects in free fall will be deflected as they pass a body like the sun, moving along a curved path in space.
This is Einstein's great general theory of relativity.
Even the path of light can be bent.
When the bending is large enough, it will revolve around the orbit of the sun's motion, just as the earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is a natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn't realize that if you squeezed the sun into a sphere six kilometers in diameter - that is, if you squeezed a million times the mass of the Earth into a sphere six kilometers in diameter, you would create a black hole, an object so dense that if light got too close to it, it wouldn't be able to escape - leaving a huge black shadow in the universe.
However, Einstein always believed that a black hole is just a mathematical singularity.
He doesn't believe that black holes really exist.
He believes that nature will prevent the formation of black holes to protect us.
It was not until decades later that people began to use the term "black hole" and realized that black holes are real objects - in fact, they are the dead state of some very massive stars after a catastrophic collapse at the end of their lives.
Our sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
Its mass is actually not large enough.
But if we do some thought experiments - Einstein was very fond of doing this - we can imagine crushing the sun and compressing it within six kilometers, and then putting a small Earth in orbit around it, say 30 kilometers away from the black hole sun.
The Earth will shine on its own, because now the sun is gone and we have no other source of light - so our little Earth has to shine on its own.
You will find that you can even put the Earth in orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and let it orbit happily.
The black hole is actually only about the size of Manhattan.
Before it destroys the earth, it may swell to Hudson Street.
But that's basically what we're talking about.
We're talking about an object that's compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this Earth close to the black hole - 30 kilometers - and we noticed that it follows a perfect orbit around the black hole.
There are some rumors that the black hole will swallow everything in the universe, but in fact you have to be very close to actually fall into it.
But the impressive thing is that from our perspective, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from the earth falls into the black hole, but some of it is bent by the black hole and is seen by us.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the plot of Battlestar Galactica and you are fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it is not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them were eating the Milky Way, it would look like this.
We will see the shadow of a black hole cast on the hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way and on the dust lanes illuminated by the stars.
If we were to fall into this black hole, we would see light being refracted around the black hole, and we wouldn't even begin to enter the shadow without sensing that some huge change was quietly taking place.
If we try to fire up the rocket and get out of there, it won't end well, because we can't escape, not even light can escape.
Although a black hole is dark from the outside, it is not so from the inside, because the light of all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even then, due to the time dilation effect of relativity, our clock seems to slow down compared to the time of the Milky Way, which looks as if the galaxy outside is accelerating, just before we ourselves are destroyed by the black hole.
It's like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a full-on death experience.
(Laughter) You can't tell anybody that you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
So far, we have never seen the shadow left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they cannot be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scenario - imagine two black holes that have been together for a very long time.
Perhaps they were stars before collapsing into two black holes - each with a mass 10 times that of the Sun.
Now we've squeezed them into 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of their lives, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Thousands of kilometers can be traversed in a fraction of a second, and in the process, they not only bend space, but also create a vibration of space in the wake behind them, a real space-time wave.
Black holes squeeze and stretch space as they collide with the universe.
These vibrations travel through space at the speed of light.
The computer simulation was done by NASA Goddard's Relativity Group.
It took nearly 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes orbiting each other, and these are imaginary curves.
As you can see - it may be a bit blurry - you can see the red waves being emitted, and these are gravitational waves.
They are the actual sounds of the universe, which will travel outward from these black holes at the speed of light as they merge with each other, until the two black holes merge into a single, quietly spinning black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the squeezing and stretching of these spaces.
You can actually hear these sounds for yourself.
Of course, you will helplessly find that your head is also being squeezed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand what exactly is happening.
But I'd like to play you the sound of our prediction.
This is the result of my group's research - a relatively simple computational model.
Imagine a less massive black hole falling into a more massive black hole.
The sound you hear comes from the collision of a low-mass black hole with space as it approaches a massive black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But gradually the sound became like a drumstick beating the space, making the space vibrate like a drum.
We can predict what this sound will become.
We know that in the process of falling, the low-mass black hole will become faster and faster, and the sound will be louder.
Eventually, we will hear that the little black hole has completely fallen into the big black hole.
I've never felt it so loud - it's actually amplified here.
When I listened to it at home, I thought the sound was a bit weak.
It sounds like, ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound simulated by our research team.
I'm not going to show you an image here, because black holes don't leave any useful traces, and real space doesn't show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear it while vacationing in the cosmos, I suggest you run.
(Laughter) Better get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they are all shaking violently.
Then, they will merge into one.
That high-pitched sound is the signature of a black hole merger - a high-pitched noise at the end of the merger.
This is our prediction of what we will see.
Fortunately, we are very safe in Long Beach, California.
There is no doubt that somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
There is also no doubt that the space around us can also feel these vibrations that travel through a million light years, or from a million years ago, they travel at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these sounds are so small that we cannot hear them at all.
Some of the world's most painstakingly constructed experiments - including one called LIGO - will be able to detect vibrations in space smaller than a single atomic nucleus at a distance of four kilometres.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be surpassed in the next few years - it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to be launched in the next decade. This project is called LISA.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes - those with millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun.
In the images returned from the Hubble telescope, we see these two galaxies.
It looked like they were in a static embrace.
They may each have a massive supermassive black hole at their center.
But they are not standing still. In fact, they are merging.
The two black holes will collide, and their merger will take billions of years.
So collecting the sounds they make is beyond the limits of our human perception.
But LISA can see the final stages of two supermassive black holes that began merging a long time ago, 15 minutes before they merged.
This detection is not limited to black holes, it can also be used to detect any large perturbations in the universe - the largest of which is the "Big Bang."
When the term was coined, some people scoffed - "Oh, who would believe in the Big Bang?"
This animated short by my friends at Proton Studios shows a view of the Big Bang from the outside.
We would never really want that; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you're in the middle of the Big Bang.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world is around you, and space is swaying in disorder.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and the sound is still around us.
Galaxies gradually form, and batches of stars are formed in galaxies. On a certain planet, there is at least one such planet that is suitable for life.
Here, we frantically set up experiments, do calculations, and write computer code.
Imagine that a billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has been traveling through time and space.
We're not even here.
It's getting closer - 40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the stone walls of caves.
If the sound we're trying to capture came from the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
It was a kind of white noise, a chaotic ringing.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other process in the universe.
If we can detect these sounds, it will be like music to our ears, because this quiet echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look up at.
So in the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume on these soundtracks a little bit, and let the universe come to us in audio form.
But if we can detect those earliest moments, it will take us one step closer to understanding the Big Bang, allowing us to ask some of the most difficult, and at the same time most elusive, questions.
If we play the history of the universe backwards, we can know that there was a big bang in the past, we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our big bang the only big bang in the universe?
I mean, we can't help but ask, was there a similar big bang before that?
Will it happen again in the future?
I would say that if the significance of this question is raised to the level that TED advocates to provoke people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions, which we may indeed never answer.
But we can't help but ask: Will our universe be just an episode in a larger history?
Or are we just a branch of the multiverse - each branch having experienced its own Big Bang - maybe some of them have buzzing black holes, maybe some don't - maybe some have conscious life, maybe some don't - not part of our past, not part of our future, but somehow connected to us?
Therefore, we can't help but speculate that if there is a multiverse, is there life in other branches of this multiverse?
This is life in our multiverse.
Are there other beings in the multiverse, speculating about our existence, pondering their own origins?
If so, I can imagine them, like us, doing calculations, writing computer code, building experimental instruments, trying to detect the faint sounds that come from their origins, and wondering who else is out there.
Thank you. Thank you all.
(Applause)
One winter morning a few years ago in Johannesburg, South Africa, I was driving to work when I noticed that the city was shrouded in smog.
I drive past there almost every day, but this was unusual, I'd never seen anything like it before.
Johannesburg is known for its uniquely beautiful skyline, but it was barely visible that morning.
I soon realized that what I was seeing was a severe haze caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I knew in the old days and the skyline shrouded in smog at this moment is surging in my heart.
I am afraid that it is very likely that the once colorful sunset scenery will be swallowed up by the dark haze.
At that moment, I felt a strong urge to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
All I know is that I can't just stand by and watch.
The biggest challenge is that I don't know anything about environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I'm a computer engineer, and I'm pretty sure I can't code my way out of air pollution.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I'm just a commoner.
Over the next few years, I learned an important lesson that we should all take to heart if we want to achieve a better future.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular field, your professional skills may contain ways to solve problems in that field.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking to sway the situation, but you need to be bold to try.
Only then can you know the outcome.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to make a difference, I had to know enough about pollution, so I became a student again.
I did some basic research and quickly learned that air pollution is the world's largest environmental health risk.
Data from the World Health Organization show that in 2012, almost 14% of deaths worldwide were caused by air pollution in and around the home, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Air pollution causes more deaths each year than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation, or deaths from child malnutrition, pale in comparison to air pollution, which also carries a huge economic cost: more than $400 billion in 2013, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In my work, I explore the technological frontiers of artificial intelligence, including the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, to find beneficial footholds and help us make better decisions.
When I think about air pollution again, it becomes clear that we need to find better ways to make better decisions about how to deal with air pollution. Given the enormity of the problem, collaboration is essential.
So I decided to get to know some people who work in this field.
I started talking to officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, I joined the local scientific community, and I made some phone calls to complete strangers who were related.
These experiences, which I set out to intervene in, helped me understand the problem more deeply.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my line of work sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: adopting a technology quickly, before they've really mastered the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I began to ask myself how I could effectively blend my knowledge and skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the expertise of the people I was connecting with.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant predictions to judge possible outcomes.
I am sure that my idea can be a realistic solution, but it also faces uncertainty, and I cannot guarantee that it will succeed.
What I have is a specific set of engineering skills, skills that I've acquired from my work. (Laughter) Of course, my skills are new to people who have been working in the field of air pollution for many years.
I've come to realize that sometimes a fresh perspective, a new combination of skills, can lead to something remarkable.
Our willpower and imagination are a beacon that tells us to overcome obstacles and start a new chapter.
After gaining a deeper understanding of the air pollution problem and finding air pollution data over the past decade, as well as meteorological data in and around Johannesburg, I worked with colleagues in South Africa and China to create an air quality decision support system and upload it to the cloud.
The software can analyze historical and real-time data to reveal trends in pollution over time and space.
We then used new machine learning techniques to predict future pollution several days in advance.
This means that residents can make better decisions about their daily itinerary and where to settle down with their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events in advance and define heavy pollution sources, so that the relevant authorities can issue orders to adjust their business activities.
Through auxiliary scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as residential settlement in industrial areas.
We have established an early pilot of the technology, which ran for 120 days and covered the whole of South Africa.
Our expectations were validated, and the predictive data we presented showed a close correlation with the data we collected in the field.
Through our management, we have introduced world-leading state-of-the-art instruments to predict air quality with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city I drove into on a recent winter morning when I said to myself, "Something is wrong, and I have to do something about it."
So, the point is: What if I hadn't investigated the problem of air pollution?
What if I didn't pay attention to the state of the country's environment, but hoped that someone, somewhere else, would take care of these things?
What I've learned is that when it comes to advancing a cause we all believe in, it's important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequences of inaction.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance. It should motivate us to go further.
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find your natural curiosity piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or brave idea, even if it's not your area of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why not go ahead and solve the problem? Do your best, in your own way?
You may be in for a surprise.
Thank you all.
(Applause)
Many people think that driving is something that only those who can see can do.
Blind people trying to safely drive a car alone has, until now, been considered an impossible task.
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we have created a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly talk about another project I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.
It's about building a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the start button, don't touch anything else, and it reaches its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 challenge, our team won $500,000 for third place in the competition.
Around that time, the National Association for the Blind, or NAB, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow blind people to drive independently and safely.
We thought we'd give it a try, because we thought, hey, this is going to be hard.
We already have an autonomous car.
All we have to do is get blind people to drive on the inside, and we're done, right?
(Laughter) But we couldn't be more wrong.
What the Blind Association wants is not a car that can carry blind people around, but a car that blind people can actively make choices and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had and start from scratch.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sand buggy to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to use this car for a ride.
It was definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with the car is that it is designed to be driven by a blind person in a very limited environment, like a closed parking lot - or even on a path made of red traffic cones.
So with this success, we decided to take the important next step and build a real car that can drive on real roads.
So how does it work?
Well, it's a relatively complex system, but let me explain and simplify.
We have three phases.
We have the sensing stage, the computing stage, and the non-visual interface.
The driver is clearly invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
For this, we use the initial metering element.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- just like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combine this information with the Global Positioning System to predict where the vehicle is.
We also use two cameras to detect the path of the vehicle.
We also use three laser rangefinders.
The laser scans the environment to detect obstacles - vehicles approaching from the front, from the rear, as well as any obstacles in the way, and any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the massive amounts of information are then aggregated into computers, which do two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment - which is the driving path, which is the obstacle - and translate this information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent and can calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle's operating procedures.
But the question is: How can we transmit information and instructions quickly and accurately enough to a blind person to ensure that he can drive?
To this end, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional flat sound system, vibrating vests, voice-activated gears, leg straps, and even shoes that put pressure on the feet.
But today we're talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
It's a pair of gloves that have vibrating elements in the knuckles so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive - direction and amplitude.
The other device is called the Velocity Shock Band.
The chair -- actually, it's a massage chair.
We take it apart, we reassemble the vibrating elements in different modes, we have them transmit speed information, but also instructions on how to use the accelerator and the brake.
Here you can see how the computer understands the surroundings, and because you can't see the vibrations, we actually put red LEDs on the driver so he can see what's going on.
This is the sensed data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, the driving handle and the speed shock belt, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are command suggestive devices.
So it's not really freedom, is it?
The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this the co-pilot problem.
So we're avoiding the instruction-suggestion device and focusing more on the information device.
A typical example of such a non-visual information interface is called an empty graph.
Think of this as a monitor for the blind.
It's a small table with a lot of holes in it, and compressed air is removed from it so that it can be described as a picture.
So even if you are blind and you put your hand on it, you can sense the route and the obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency of the emission in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the left and right cameras and how the computer parses and transmits this information to the sky map.
So we're showing a simulation where a blind person is driving with an empty map.
This program is very helpful for training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different kinds of non-visual user interfaces.
That's basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won't be on the road until it's proven to be as safe to drive as today's cars, or safer.
I truly believe this will happen.
But are societies, are they receptive to this radical idea?
What are we going to do about insurance?
How will we issue driver's licenses?
Behind the technical challenges, there are a lot of different obstacles that we need to solve before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project is to design a car driven by a blind person.
But potentially more important than that is the enormous value embedded in the by-products of this project.
Sensors that can be used to see through darkness, rain and fog.
And with this new kind of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for the visual population.
Or for the blind, household devices in daily life - educational facilities, office facilities application services.
Imagine a teacher writing notes on a blackboard in class. Blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher is writing.
This is extremely valuable.
Today, what I have shown you is just the beginning.
Thank you very much.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my artwork, I try to illustrate that humans are not separate from nature, but that everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I saw icebergs for the first time.
I was in awe.
My heart was beating fast and I was dizzy, trying to understand what this was in front of me.
The iceberg next to me was almost 200 feet above the surface, and I could only wonder if it was one snowflake covering another, year after year.
Icebergs form when they break off from a glacier or break off from an ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their surroundings and their circumstances.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and persevere to the end, while others can't bear to break the ice in a moment of violent passion.
When you look at icebergs, it's easy to think that they're all isolated, that they're separate and alone, rather like how we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But the reality is much more than that.
As the iceberg melts, I breathe in its ancient scent.
As the iceberg melts, it releases fresh water rich in minerals that nourish everything.
I set out to photograph these icebergs as if I were taking a portrait of my ancestors, understanding that in these individual moments, the icebergs had existed in that way but would never exist like that again.
When they melt, it is by no means a death; it is by no means an end, but a continuation of the road to endless life.
The icebergs I have photographed, some of the ice is very young - thousands of years old.
Some of the ice is more than 100,000 years old.
The last image I want to show you is an iceberg that I photographed on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
This is a very rare opportunity to actually witness an iceberg roll over.
So this is what it looks like.
On the left you can see a small boat.
This is a boat of about 15 feet.
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg, its deformation on the surface of the water.
Here you see it start to roll, the boat moves to the other side and a man is standing there.
This is an average-sized Greenland iceberg.
It surfaced about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
The video was shot in real time.
(Music) Like this iceberg, they show you different sides of their personality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you know how many medium flowering plants there are?
There are 250,000 - at least that's how many we know about - 250,000 species of flowering plants.
And flowers are a nuisance.
It's really hard to get plants to reproduce.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why is this so troubling?
The answer, of course, is, like so many other things in the world, gender.
I know what goes through your mind when you look at these pictures.
The reason sexual reproduction is so important -- plants have many other ways to reproduce.
Can be used in the form of cuttings; can reproduce with both sexes of the same plant; can pollinate the same plant.
But they do need to spread their genes and mix with other genes, so that they can be ecological.
This is how evolution works.
Now the way plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these images before.
As I said, every home should have a scanning electron microscope that can see this.
There are as many different types of pollen as there are species of flowering plants.
This is actually quite useful for forensic science and so on.
Most of the pollen that gives us hay fever comes from plants that use the wind to spread their pollen. This is a very inefficient process, which is why pollen always ends up in our nose.
Because most of them are discarded, the hope is that the germ cells contained in the pollen, the male germ cells, will be able to fall by chance onto another flower.
All grasses, which means all grains, and most trees rely on the wind to spread pollen.
But most species actually use insects to complete the process, which is smarter in a way, because it doesn't require as much pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, transferring it directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we notice the relationship between insects and plants.
It's a symbiotic relationship, and whether it's the birds or the bees, they get something in return, usually nectar.
Sometimes this symbiotic relationship leads to wonderful adaptations - the red-skirted hawkmoth is a beautiful adaptation.
Plants also have a harvest, and Tianya spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolved to create landing strips everywhere, and bees can get lost in them.
Many plants have markings that look like those of other insects.
These are the pollen sacs of lilies, which are very clever, so when an unsuspecting insect lands on it, the pollen sac flips over and hits the insect on the back with a lot of pollen, so it can follow the insect to other plants.
There's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a way, it does; it forces insects to crawl over it, pick up the pollen, and carry it somewhere else.
Orchids: There are at least 20,000 species of orchids -- an amazing variety.
They have all kinds of tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete the process.
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because it was studied by Darwin and he made a wonderful prediction when he saw this orchid, you can see here a very long nectar tube hanging down from the orchid.
Basically what the insect has to do is - we're in the middle of the flower - it sticks its proboscis into the middle part all the way down the nectar tube to get the nectar.
Looking at the flower, Darwin said, "I suspect that something has co-evolved with it."
Insects, no doubt.
I mean, usually it's rolled up, but when it's straightened out, it looks like this.
Now imagine that if nectar, which is such a valuable thing, is expensive for plants to produce and attracts lots of pollinators, then, as in human sexuality, people might start cheating on each other.
They might say, "I have some nectar. Would you like to come and get some?"
This is a plant.
The plant is loved by insects in South Africa, which have evolved long mouthparts to access the nectar at the base.
It's a copycat.
This plant is mimicking the previous one.
There was a fly with a long beak that didn't get any nectar from the impostor, because the impostor didn't give it any nectar. It thought it could get it.
So not only does the fly not get the nectar from the fake plant, but - if you look very closely at the top of the head, you'll see that there's some pollen there that will be spread to other plants if no botanist comes along and sticks it on a blue card.
(Laughter) This lie is all over the plant kingdom.
The flower with the black dots: They may look like black dots to us, but I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, these look like two very, very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, dips itself into the pollen, which, of course, will be carried by it to other plants, and if you look at the images from the scanning electron microscope, which every home should have, you can see that there are actually patterns there, three-dimensional patterns.
It can even make insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electron microscope images - this is an orchid masquerading as an insect - you can see that for our eyes, different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, and insects may be able to perceive very, very different textures.
The orchid has evolved to mimic the shiny metallic surfaces seen on some beetles.
You can see this surface under a scanning electron microscope -- it's very different from other surfaces we've looked at.
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even if it looks like an insect to us.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
It's a wonderful, magical thing.
That's the clever thing about it. It's called obsidian.
I think it is sometimes devious.
To a species-appropriate bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee that's going to come and headbutt it many, many times, try to chase it away, and of course, it's going to get pollen on it.
The other thing it does is that the plant mimics another orchid that is rich in food that insects love.
But there was nothing.
So it's cheating on two levels - it's unbelievable.
(Laughter) What we see is ylang-ylang, the strongly scented part.
I've actually smelled it before.
These flowers don't really need to be so showy.
They give off a wonderful scent that attracts any insect that is interested.
This flower doesn't smell good.
This flower actually smells really bad, and again, this is evolution, and it looks like carrion.
So the flies love it.
The flies fly in and pollinate it.
This is white star anemone, also known as dead horse anemone.
I don't know what dead horses smell like, but this flower probably smells a lot like it.
It was horrible.
The greenfly couldn't help himself.
Fly into it, fly all the way into it.
Laying eggs on it, thinking it's a nice piece of carrion, not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs will die here, but at the same time the plant will benefit, because the stiff hairs are loosened, the flies are gone, pollination to another flower - wonderful.
This is the yarrow plant, European yarrow, variegated arum, known in this country as trillium.
I took this in Dorset last week.
This guy heats up about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature -- incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the spike is something that looks like a dam, and the flies are attracted to the heat - it's a boiling volatile chemical, the bugs - and they're trapped under this container.
They drink the sweet nectar and then they all get a little sticky.
At night they are covered in pollen, which is sprayed down on them, and then the stiff hairs that we see on them wither and allow these pollen-covered bugs to escape - it's incredible.
If you think this is unbelievable, this one is my favorite.
This is spring feather green velvet.
Those of you who are from Brazil should know this plant.
It's the most amazing thing.
Its stamens are about a foot long.
It has an ability that I don't think any other plant has, and when it blooms - this is the spike in the middle - for about two days, it produces a degree of metabolic change that is somewhat mammalian.
It doesn't have starch, which is plant food, it has something very similar to brown fat, and it burns it at the rate of burning fat, metabolizing it, at about the rate of a kitten.
That's twice the energy output of a hummingbird by weight - absolutely staggering.
It also did something unusual.
Not only will it heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Celsius, for two days, but it will maintain a constant temperature.
There is a temperature regulation mechanism to maintain a constant temperature.
Why do this? I hear you ask.
You don't know it yet, but some beetles like to mate at this temperature.
They burrow in and get covered in pollen.
(Laughter) The plants sprinkle them with pollen and let them go and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
Now we think that most pollinators are insects, but in fact in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.
Many tropical flowers are red, because butterflies and birds are similar to us and, we think, can see red very well.
But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue see this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they can see various shades of ultraviolet light.
There's some color behind that.
"Wouldn't it be nice if we could see those colors," I hear you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
So what do insects see?
Last week I took these pictures of desert lilies, a genus of half-day flowers, in Dorset.
As we can see, these are little yellow flowers, and these little yellow flowers are everywhere.
In visible light it looks like this.
If you remove the red it looks like this.
Most bees cannot perceive red.
Then I put an ultraviolet filter in front of my lens and exposed it for a long time at a specific frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this picture.
It was like a real, wonderful bull's-eye.
Now we don't know exactly what the bees are seeing, but when I call it red, you know what I'm looking at.
We have no way of knowing what's going on in there, whether it's an insect or another human brain.
But the contrast looks something like this. It stands out from the background.
Here's another little flower - in a different UV frequency range, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It looks something like this.
Lest you think that all yellow flowers have this property - no damage was done to the flower during the shoot; it was just attached to the tripod, not taken off - look at this under ultraviolet light.
This could serve as the basis for sunscreen, which works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
So maybe the chemicals in it are useful.
And finally, here's an evening primrose sent to me by Bjorn Rorslett in Norway - a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this way of hiding.
I think it's very poetic. These pictures were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is what astronomers use to photograph Venus - actually the clouds on Venus.
This is the main use of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, which is the language of flowers.
Just as flowers spend so much energy trying to entice pollinators to accept their invitation, somehow they've also managed to convince us that there's a richness in the way we send flowers to each other at birth and at death, and especially at weddings, when you think about it, at the very moment that genetic material is being transferred from one organism to another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
